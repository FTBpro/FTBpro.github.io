<p>A successful relationship between dev &amp; design is key to achieving a good product. However, unfortunately in most places it is not the case. Today in Minute Media, designers and developers are working together in a good and healthy atmosphere - but it took a lot of work to get to this point, and it takes constant work to maintain it.</p>

<p>In this post I will share our journey to success and some of the pitfalls along the way.</p>

<h2 id="common-points-of-friction">Common Points of Friction</h2>

<p>There is always a reason why the relationship goes sour. Once it does you need to find a way to fix it, and the sooner the better. Small points of tension can soon become a rift between the teams. And rifts can turn into complete disconnection, where the teams consider each other enemies. In order to avoid this, let’s take a closer look and understand the 2 major points of friction.</p>

<h3 id="lack-of-involvement">Lack of Involvement</h3>

<p>One of the reasons is lack of dev involvement in the design process. Imagine that you’re a front end developer and you’re sitting in a kick-off meeting for a new feature. The development starts tomorrow and this is the first time you’re going to see the design.</p>

<p>As a designer, I’ve unfortunately been in this situation many times . At one time we showed the design and it was the first time the developers had seen the project. They couldn’t focus on the design at all. They were focused on time-frames and project scope, instead of the UX and flow. Things got ugly, and the kick-off meeting turned into a war zone within minutes.</p>

<h3 id="project-scope">Project Scope</h3>

<p>What happened after that horrible meeting, was a change in scope - and now please place yourself in my shoes. You’ve been working on this feature for quite some time and you just got slammed. You’re probably thinking, even if just for a second ‘Argh.. all this hard working for nothing!”</p>

<p>Changes in scope can go both ways. We had a big project that required code refactoring during the project. The developers had to refactor most of their code, since we found a better solution. Change of scope is frustrating, because at the end of the day we all want to do meaningful work.</p>

<h2 id="mending-the-rifts">Mending the Rifts</h2>

<p>We all want to get to the point where the teams are working good together. But how to get to this point and where to start? Getting there is no easy task, there are no magic words to make it better. You need to work for it, and the first thing you need to do is build a foundation of trust.</p>

<h3 id="get-personal">Get personal</h3>

<p>The first thing I started doing was build some kind of personal relationship. I would sit next to the developers and start with ‘good morning’ and a smile. Then I would start talking about casual stuff. ׳Did you see the new coffee machine in the kitchen?’ Or ‘what do you think about last night’s episode? And now comes the best part, after a light conversation I would dive deeper and ask questions like:
- What do you think we should do differently?
- How can we work better?
- What is your past experience with working with designers/developers?</p>

<p>Your peers will appreciate you for this because you actually care about what they think.</p>

<h3 id="transparency">Transparency</h3>

<p>If you’ve asked those questions you’ve probably heard that they want to be more involved. Developers don&rsquo;t want to be code-monkeys, and designers don&rsquo;t want to create pretty things.</p>

<p>Don’t be afraid to lower the walls and show the developers what you’re working on, even if it’s still WIP. The sooner the people who are actually building the project see it, the sooner they will become familiar with it. If you had seen the project along the way, you wouldn’t be surprised in the kick-off meeting and would have less issues with it.</p>

<h3 id="feedback">Feedback</h3>

<p>Only showing the design will only get you so far, you need to also let the developers give their own feedback. Not only you will have a fresh set of eyes looking at the project. You will also get feedback about the complexity, missing states and abnormalities.</p>

<p>I like to bounce ideas off developers, because they don’t live in the same world of design limitations as I do. They can come up with the simplest solutions, or be completely off track. Either way, they will appreciate you for asking for feedback and have a better understanding of your challenges.</p>

<h3 id="switch-hats">Switch Hats</h3>

<p>Let the developers understand the work that you do. I presented our dev team with the process of one of our recent projects. I showed everything, from gathering requirements to the final design. I remember the look on their faces when they saw that it took over 30 versions to reach the final version.</p>

<p>It is as important for a designer to wear the developer hat. It will enable you to understand the problems and limitations early on . Get dirty and try to understand the fundamentals of code-writing.</p>

<h3 id="find-solutions-together">Find solutions together</h3>

<p>When you ship the design to the developers to work on, make sure both sides know what to expect. Go over the spec together, ask questions and leave the meeting with everything you need to know.</p>

<p>When the coding starts, developers will have questions or encounter problems. Work on these points together, putting the product at the center and not your ego or feelings. Understand what the crucial points are and what points you can compromise on.</p>

<h3 id="visual-bugs">Visual Bugs</h3>

<p>The development is done, and the project is now in a QA environment. Don’t forget to let the designer see it and provide feedback. Because as much as you tried to go over the spec and did exactly what was written, you probably missed something. It is the designer’s job to explore the project and dive into the details.</p>

<p>It is also important to prioritize visual bugs, because sometimes we won’t have enough time to fix all the issues. It is ok to go live with some visual bugs, as long as both sides agree on it and that those bugs will be prioritized in the future.</p>

<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping Up</h2>

<p>We all need to remember that we’re in it for the same reason - to create an amazing product, and have some fun along the way. Making the effort to improve the relationship with our developers truly made a difference, yet not everything is perfect and we still have a way to go. Because when you’re dealing with people it is hard to find a process that fits all. So do get personal and tweak it to fit yourself and your peers.</p>
