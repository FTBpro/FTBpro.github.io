<p>As any other mature startup that is moving to its growth stage, we had to rebuild our infrastructure. Our initial infrastructure was a Monolithic application in Ruby on Rails. Regardless of the technology that we chose, the goal was to create
tools and company wide standards. We set out to explore.</p>

<p>Our teams are in a cross-functional organization with clear and sometimes separate business goals. During our exploration, each team ventured out on its own, testing technologies like Node and Go. Few weeks in, we realized that we had some communication problems. When we had the opportunity to share our work,, we noticed similar technical and design problems across teams.</p>

<p>To avoid the path of siloing the teams, solving similar technical problems and doing the same work twice. We tried our new development efforts in a monorepo.</p>

<p>A Monorepo, is simply, a monolithic repository. The idea is to keep all, or most, of the projects in the company in one single repository. The concept is not new and has been in practice for 10 years. Used by very large companies like Google, Facebook, Twitter, Uber, etc.</p>

<p>After using monmorepo for over a year, I would like to share some of the benefits and the road ahead.</p>

<h3 id="introduce-transparency">Introduce Transparency</h3>

<p>All our codebase is accessible by all team members, but when projects each had their own repo, we rarely found ourselves reviewing other team’s code.</p>

<p>We are enabling all team members to view the entire code base. Most of the code is owned by separate teams, so if you are interested in seeing what other teams are doing, you can view the pull request. The barrier to doing so is extremely low, since it is just another PR in the repository that you also use. Team members regularly find themselves browsing other teams’ PRs.</p>

<p>This state generates a subconscious thought to create better and more readable code, since your code is in the open, similar to the open source effect.</p>

<h3 id="build-alignment">Build Alignment</h3>

<p>When everything is visible and accessible in a single repo, it is much easier to agree and enforce standards. Every team has its own special standards, but we are trying to be more aligned. All standards are tested and implemented in each respective team, once proven useful all teams agree and the standard is implemented across the entire monorepo.</p>

<p>Standards we recently implemented:</p>

<ul>
<li>Directory structure for restful services in Go</li>
<li>Switching from Javascript to Typescript</li>
<li>Linting rules for Javascript projects</li>
<li>Documentation formatting</li>
<li>Authentication</li>
<li>Deployment and monitoring</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="share-ideas">Share Ideas</h3>

<p>We are seeing better cross system architectural designs. This was very hard to spot before, especially for services that are in separate repositories. Similar functionality is easy to spot and extract. Building an in-house framework to support and increase delivery velocity use it in one service and then apply.
Using one codebase allows participants to spot new or similar ideas. For example, you can use a service that categorises videos according to the transcript, or for categorising news articles as well.</p>

<h3 id="integrate-early">Integrate Early</h3>

<p>Since the whole system is in one big repo, writing integration tests and launching the entire system in docker is a breeze. We are able to detect integration problems extremely early.</p>

<p>Using docker compose, you can spin up the entire end to end system on your laptop. This enables more elaborate features, like spinning ad hoc QA environments or demos for clients.</p>

<h3 id="allow-for-simpler-maintenance">Allow for Simpler Maintenance</h3>

<p>Language upgrades and security patches are applied across all the code at once. Maintaining and updating external dependencies is much simpler, and more accessible than before.</p>

<p>Upgrading from Go 1.10 to 1.11 was done by a single developer over a period of 2-3 days, on 20 different services.</p>

<h3 id="corners-to-smooth">Corners to smooth</h3>

<p>Like everything else in software development, a monorepo requires some discipline. Just like sharing ideas is easy, so is breaking service encapsulation.</p>

<p>Not everybody feels comfortable sharing all the code all the time. Sometimes sharing creates discussion, where there should just be a simple decision.</p>

<p>Once the code grows it becomes slower to push/pull requests - we are working towards better integration.</p>

<p>We are still pretty much at the beginning of this experiment, there are many things that we need to add to our tool box:</p>

<ul>
<li>List of rules for monorepo</li>
<li>Automated project generation</li>
<li>Template deploy scripts</li>
<li>Pull request templates</li>
<li>Using directed graph build systems, like Bazel or Buck</li>
</ul>

<p>There are also a lot of technical benefits that can be achieved using a monorepo. With some work, I&rsquo;m sure that the same technical benefits can be achieved as with a multi repo.
Most importantly though,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>introducing a tool that generates transparency and alignment is far more important than any technical advantage.</p>
