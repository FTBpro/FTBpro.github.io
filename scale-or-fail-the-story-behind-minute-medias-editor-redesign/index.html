<h1 id="scale-or-fail-the-story-behind-minute-media-s-editor-redesign">Scale or Fail: The Story Behind Minute Media’s Editor Redesign</h1>

<p>In 2015, Minute Media released its Editor to more than 200 writers and 20 content managers. For the next almost two years, thousands of articles were only curated and published to <a href="http://90min.com">90min</a>, our old flagship football brand.</p>

<p>Since then though, the company has grown and added multiple brands to its name, such as <a href="http://12up.com">12up</a> - focused on American sports, <a href="http://dbltap.com">DBLTAP</a>  - our Esports site, <a href="http://12up.com">Floor8</a>  - the entertainment hub, <a href="http://mentalfloss.com">Mental Floss</a>  - adestination for curious people, &amp; <a href="http://fanduel/theduel.com">TheDuel</a> - targeting fantasy football fans.</p>

<p>This meant that writers and content managers across all of these brands were using the Editor launched in 2015, which was originally conceptualized to fit the needs of only one specific brand. It became obvious the Editor was outdated and needed an overhaul.</p>

<p>In this post, I&rsquo;ll discuss the process we underwent as a team, the challenges I faced as a product designer and the issues we solved along the way to defining and designing our new state of the art editor.</p>

<h2 id="defining-the-problem">Defining the problem</h2>

<p>Multiple issues became more and more apparent. Firstly, the Editor’s user interface was designed based on 90min’s look and feel. Secondly, the Editor’s article output was HTML, which in technical terms is far from ideal. In order to support additional content formats and more flexibility when it comes to user experience, it should be changed to JSON.</p>

<p>In addition, the old editor posed challenges when it came to monetization. The article WYSIWYG created empty paragraphs which prevented optimizing the ad performance and element integration. Furthermore, the Editor has an unforgiving nature, which negatively affects user experience. Any error a writer does when placing an image will force him to delete, re-upload and reposition it before achieving a simple positional change. Whether it was from our editorial side or from the company’s strategic perspective, the editor made it very difficult for us to scale.</p>

<h2 id="research-first">Research first</h2>

<p>As a product designer, every new project starts with research. After scanning the market, I got inspired by famous and universally established editors such as Medium, Storify, Wix, Behance &amp; Squarespace. Unique and serving different audiences, they are all well thought out, and several features in our new editor are based on some of their functionalities.</p>

<p>In addition to analyzing the market, I studied the habits and behaviors of our in-house editors and writers. I watched them work and did countless interviews, in which I asked about their experience with the product, their impressions of use, the main pain points, and the features they liked and/or would like to see improved.</p>

<p>It was important for me to involve all of the editorial team in the process, because when they eventually get access to the new Editor we are creating, they will feel they had a real impact on the new product.
We created a survey and shared it with all of our writers and content managers across all of our offices around the world. In this survey, we collected data about their preferences regarding new features, new article templates, and potential ideas.</p>

<p>One of the main takeaways from this research was the need for a drag &amp; drop solution. More than 66% of all participants were looking for the ability to reorder paragraphs and media items. This led us to take a block-based approach when conceptualizing the editor.</p>

        </figcaption>
</figure>


<h2 id="think-generic-think-scale">Think generic, think scale</h2>

<p>Since Minute Media’s vision is focused on creating an open platform for any publisher in need of publishing tools, we created the editor as a stand-alone product. We reshaped our design and adapted our platform with a common visual language, color hierarchy, component behavior, layout and grid which we can customize and update easily.</p>

<figure>

            <h4>Part of our design system</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>Because we are dealing with a storytelling product, we used a one-third-two-thirds layout. The two-thirds are used for the writing functionalities canvas and the one-third allows the user to insert any type of media to the article.
Because this product will be licensed out, we added functionalities in order to facilitate the article creation flow. There is now a progress bar above the writing canvas, guiding the user through the different steps they need to take in order to publish an article. The sub-header not only includes the progress bar, but moreover, tooltips, a saving indication, and CTA buttons.</p>

<p>It forced us to think systematically and generically about where to write a new paragraph, how to edit text, how to add media to enrich the content and where the writer can see their process.</p>

            <h4>Editor grid &amp; layout</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>


<h2 id="from-article-templates-to-content-blocks">From article templates to content blocks</h2>

<p>The original editor supported multiple article templates. These capabilities were added to allow writers to increase content variety, and differentiate our platform from traditional publishers. While the idea certainly had merit, several problems became more apparent over time.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,w_875/v1561366636/techblog/90min-editor-templates-screen.png"/> <figcaption>
            <h4>Our old choosing template screen</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>Firstly, as mentioned earlier, the unforgiving nature of the editor meant there was no way for you to go back and change the template if you had already started writing the article. You would have had to restart a new article and copy&amp;paste the contents. Another challenge was the layers of code needed to support several templates. Over time, when more article templates were added, this led to a complicated product with a lot of bugs and issues and high maintenance costs.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,w_875/v1561366634/techblog/Plus-animation.gif"/> <figcaption>
            <h4>Our &#43; button opens the content blocks type</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>What I realized during the research, was that every article template had key features in common. They all needed a cover image, a title, article tags, &amp; SEO descriptions to improve the ranking of the article search engines. In essence, the differences from template to template entailed changes in the <em>article body</em>. The question arose: why should the writer have to choose an article template before starting to write? This is when we made the difficult decision to completely overhaul our approach and conceptualize <strong>one single article type</strong>, out of which the user would be able to create multiple templates by adding different content blocks.</p>

<p>Convincing everyone involved in the project to move away from templates, in favor of this new concept was difficult. Templates had been the bread and butter of the editorial team for years. Our new approach, however, gives the editors more freedom, room for creativity and responsibility to write new types of articles they couldn’t before.</p>

<p>The new block-based editor won’t change the way any of our content looks to our readers. What it will do, is let the writers insert any type of multimedia in a snap and rearrange it the way they please. Each piece of content will be in its own block; a distinct wrapper for easy maneuvering.</p>

<h3 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping Up</h3>

<p>If in the old editor it took days for the developing team to add a feature, in the current editor we’ve made sure to create generic infrastructures to guarantee easy scalability. While it took developers days to add the ability to embed different social media into our article, the same task only takes a few hours today.</p>

<p>My main goal through all this process was to create a very intuitive product with no specific and no unknown behaviors, which allows us to scale the editor with the ability to add new features and to improve the product along the way.</p>

<p>Many of our choices have been warranted so far, as we have received positive feedback from our teams using the product since its launch in December. A further vindication for our approach has been WordPress’s new editor release <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2018/12/bebo/">(WordPress 5.0 &ldquo;Bebo”)</a>. Their biggest change was similar to ours, an approach which included content blocks.</p>
