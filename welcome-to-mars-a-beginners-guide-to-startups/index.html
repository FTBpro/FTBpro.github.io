<p>A Beginners Guide to Hi-tech</p>

<p>So, you got accepted to your dream job in a successful startup company. You passed about 6 interviews, a home assignment (in my case a design assignment), you signed an 11 page contract (in English of course) and now you are about to start working&hellip;but wait - do you know what you are actually getting yourself in to? If not, this article is for you.</p>

<p>6 months ago I got accepted as a Product Designer in MinuteMedia. As a former studio designer, who came from a media company, it was very exciting for me to start working in hi-tech.
What I didn’t know back then, is how different it was going to be from everything I had known before. I don’t mean different in the way that everything is in English, and that the kitchen is always full with groceries (yum). I mean different in the terminology, in the working methods, and in many other things I really didn’t expect.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>

<p>As you all know, the first day at a new job is always challenging. Beside the fact that you don’t know anyone, or even where the toilets are, your bigger problem is that you don’t know the company. You might know some things in general - but it takes time to understand the product, the vibe, the lingo.
Some of the things that helped me get onboard quickly was many many meetings that filled my calendar from day 1: weekly, bi-weekly, Product weekly, Tech update, Product reviews, etc. Another thing was &ldquo;one on one&rdquo; introduction meetings that my manager had scheduled for me with different co-workers from different positions in the company, so they could tell me about what they do. Those meetings were very helpful and helped me understand things much faster.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-they-talking-about">What are they talking about?</h2>

<p>If this is your first job in a hi-tech company, in the beginning you might feel like you landed on Mars. When I joined MinuteMedia, half of the words and terms I heard in all those meetings, I just didn’t understand. What (the hell) are they talking about? I felt embarrassed. I started hearing words like &ldquo;OKR&rdquo;, &ldquo;Pods&rdquo;, &ldquo;Sprint&rdquo;, &ldquo;Q1&rdquo;, &ldquo;Q2&rdquo;, &ldquo;SEO, &ldquo;CTO&rdquo;. &ldquo;PR&rdquo;, &ldquo;CTA&rdquo;, &ldquo;MVP&rdquo;, and many more. Learning all these new terms caused me one big headache. Where should I start?</p>

<p>I figured that in order to understand more, I had to ask&hellip; sometimes I asked more than once.</p>

<p>After a few days, I was able to divide most of those words into categories: words that are connected to the company’s working methods,  job titles, etc . For example SEO is Search Engine Optimization and CTO is a Chief Technology Officer. Yes, I didn’t know that.</p>

<p>There are many more terms you need to know when you are new to tech. Some of them you can read about in this <a href="https://skillcrush.com/2015/03/26/99-tech-terms/">link</a>
 I found.
Others, you will learn in time - just don’t be afraid to ask!</p>

<h2 id="working-methods">Working methods</h2>

<p>Another thing that I found very different when I first joined hi-tech, was the working methods. For example, I used to work with the other designers in a studio, far away from the developers or the product managers. My communication with them was mainly by email, and that caused many problems and misunderstandings. Also, most of the projects were not planned in advance, they always reached me at the last minute, and I never had enough time for &ldquo;ping pong&rdquo; with the developers. I was never pleased with the final result. Those things don’t really happen in hi-tech. Here are some examples why:</p>

<h3 id="pods">Pods</h3>

<p>In MinuteMedia we work in pod’s, which means that we work in a unit that is made up of different roles in the company. In this working method, I find myself working much closer with the product managers and even with the developers. These good relations between the co-workers in a pod are very important for the mutual goal. We meet and talk about the product, we understand each other’s limitations and needs. It’s a much healthier process.
You should read Michal Trujeman’s <a href="http://tech.minutemedia.com/diy-creating-a-great-relationship-between-dev-and-design/">post</a> on how we achieved that harmony.</p>

<h3 id="sprints">Sprints</h3>

<p>Every pod works in sprints. A sprint is a 2 week time frame that is dedicated to a specific task/goal. At the beginning of every sprint, the team gets together for a &ldquo;Planning&rdquo; meeting. In this meeting they decide what they are going to work on, and they set the goals for that sprint. During those 2 weeks they sometimes meet for updates, and in the end they have a &ldquo;Retro&rdquo; meeting to discuss the sprint and the outcomes.</p>

<h3 id="okr">OKR</h3>

<p>Another working method we use in the company, is dividing the year to quarters. Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4. At the beginning of the year, we all get together for an OKR (Objectives and Key Results) meeting. In this meeting, we look back on what we achieved in the past year and we set the goals in high level for the next year, using the quarter&rsquo;s method.
The meeting is managed by our CEO, who is broadcasting live from the offices in London to all of our offices around the world. He begins the OKR meeting by talking about the company’s strategic mission statement, and after that he continues to the company’s general OKR. Then, he divides the company by departments (Commercial, Operations, Finance, Tech &amp; Product, Community, HR) and talks about each department’s OKR.
At the end of every &ldquo;Q&rdquo; all the team leaders get together to discuss and grade the accomplishments of that quarter.</p>

<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping Up</h2>

<p>Being new in hi-tech is exciting, but it’s probably different than what you knew before. It might take some time to get onboard, to learn about the company and to understand the terminology. The important thing is to come a bit prepared, and to not be afraid to ask when you don’t understand something.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>
